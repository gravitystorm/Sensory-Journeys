<h1><%= @current_project.project_name %></h1>

<p><%= @current_project.project_name %> is a project by the artist Christian Nold, commissioned by Sustrans the UK sustainable transport charity. This 1 year art project involved Christian Nold working closely with 4 schools in Bristol and Sustrans Bike It team to set up a series of creative in school workshops. The concept is, that people have very different sorts of experiences and relationships with their surroundings depending on their mode of travel. The project was based on inventing and using an innovative experiential toolkit of activities, technologies and visualisations with the children for intensive workshops. The final gathered material will be designed into large scale printed maps that will be presented to the schools for public discussions with the children, teachers, governors and local politicians. If this research project proves to be successful in bringing experiential transport awareness to the children as well as local area stakeholder, the long term plan is to setup a national network of Sensory Journey Schools.</p>

<p>Guide to the software:</p>
<p>For each of the schools there are 3 types of data created by the children. The drawings represent the 5 most important experiences the children had on their journeys to school, while the blue lines are GPS tracks from the devices that the children carried their journeys to school and home. The faces icons are Experience Markers which are their reflections on events that occurred on their journeys. I recommend comparing the drawings via the different forms of transport.</p>
