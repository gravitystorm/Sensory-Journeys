== Sensory Journeys

This is a project combining various open-source projects in order to
support sensory and emotial mapping workshops. The initial development was
for a specific schools project in Bristol, and the code is slowly becoming
less hard-coded to the needs of that particular project.

There is a rough guide to how to install the project documented in INSTALL.
Further work includes pushing patches (especially to Walking Papers) upstream,
and as already mentioned, making the whole thing easier to reuse and customise.

Different parts of the project are based on various other projects. For licensing
each component is under its original license; all new code is GPLv2 (copy at wp/LICENSE).
